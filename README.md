# About

<p align="justify">
In contrast to the RMI assignment, where booking data was stored at individual car rental companies, our
central rental agency will now fully handle the infrastructure of the car rental companies that it has a
contract with. This means that processing bookings and storing the appropriate data is now centralized at
the agency. Therefore, clients only need to interact with this central agency to make several reservations
at multiple, regional rental companies.
